ðŸ”¬ 3. Based on Task Complexity
Task Type	Suggested First Hidden Layer Size
Simple classification	32â€“128 neurons
Complex classification	128â€“512 neurons
Regression with few features	16â€“64 neurons
Image processing (raw pixels)	Use CNNs, not large dense layers
NLP or time series	Often use RNNs, Transformers, or Embeddings

Output layer neurons should be equal to number if classes of problem
